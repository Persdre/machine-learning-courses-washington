# Classification 

### 1

The simple threshold classifier for sentiment analysis described in the video (check all that apply):

> Must have pre-defined positive and negative attributes


> Must either count attributes equally or pre-define weights on attributes


 Defines a possibly non-linear decision boundary

### 2

For a linear classifier classifying between “positive” and “negative” sentiment in a review x, Score(x) = 0 implies (check all that apply):

The review is very clearly “negative”


> We are uncertain whether the review is “positive” or “negative”


We need to retrain our classifier because an error has occurred

### 3

For which of the following datasets would a linear classifier perform perfectly?

### 4

True or false: High classification accuracy always indicates a good classifier.

True


> False

### 5

True or false: For a classifier classifying between 5 classes, there always exists a classifier with accuracy greater than 0.18.

> True


False

### 6

True or false: A false negative is always worse than a false positive.

True


> False

### 7

Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply)

>Test error tends to decrease with more training data until a point, and then does not change (i.e., curve flattens out)


Test error always goes to 0 with an unboundedly large training dataset


Test error is never a function of the amount of training data
